##ASAM Android
Anti-Shipping Activity Messages (ASAM) App for Android displays location and descriptive information about hostile acts against ships and mariners. The app allows users to cache warning data when connected to the Internet. Once the data is cached the app works without a Wi-Fi or cellular connection allowing users to view reports while dissconected from the Internet. The reports may be useful for recognition, prevention and avoidance of potential hostile activity. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency maintains this [warning database] (http://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_65). This app makes it easier for mariners and others to query and interact with this data on their own phone even when disconnected.  

The ASAM App was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with [Booz Allen Hamilton](http://www.boozallen.com/).  The government has ["unlimited rights"] (https://github.com/ngageoint/anti-shipping-activity-messages-android-app/blob/master/NOTICE) and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions. The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) license.
